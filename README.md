# Gps-Speed-Reminder
Gps Speed reminder ,( Stuck with lighting gp25 from 30 Mph and off at 33Mph
I'm trying to build a speed warning via GPS GPS works on its own but trying to add for now  gp25 to light at 30Mph and stay lit until 33 mph but struggling with I statement.
I would like to aventually add more speed limits with different colour led on other gpio's but for now just getting 30 to 33mph working any help much appreciated. I don't do reading pages and pages if text, I learn faster by an example as I forget quickly if I read to much info.
